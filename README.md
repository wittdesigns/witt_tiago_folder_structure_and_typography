# QU3NCH! Fresh, Delicious, and Energetic Beverage 

TODO: The website prototype created using descriptive text and a couple of images provided as reference, the images were been optimized and placed in the locations where they seemed to make sense, and the text was correctly organized by sections allowing a better flow.
Also created a Logo just using Header and changed the colors meaningfully to fit the product that was being displayed.
